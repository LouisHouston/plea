The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Got authprovider working, I understood how a provider works in React but wrapping an entire NextJS project was a little confusing because i didnt understand how the structure of the project loads. Now I completely understand the difference between the _app.tsx apporach and the layout.tsx with page.tsx and subdirectories work.
